# mnist_knn_numpy
simple knn applied to mnist using numpy 

A quick and simple implementation.\
TO RUN:\
$ python mnist_knn_numpy.py

The program should produce the following output when run unmodified:
>-----------------------------------------------------------------------

We have 1347 items in the training set & 449 items for test\
Iteration 00 With k = 01  ==> Result: Accuracy 96.21% (432 correct predictions out of 449)\
Iteration 01 With k = 03  ==> Result: Accuracy 97.10% (436 correct predictions out of 449)\
Iteration 02 With k = 05  ==> Result: Accuracy 96.44% (433 correct predictions out of 449)\
Iteration 03 With k = 07  ==> Result: Accuracy 95.55% (429 correct predictions out of 449)\
Iteration 04 With k = 09  ==> Result: Accuracy 95.55% (429 correct predictions out of 449)\
Iteration 05 With k = 11  ==> Result: Accuracy 95.77% (430 correct predictions out of 449)\
Iteration 06 With k = 17  ==> Result: Accuracy 95.32% (428 correct predictions out of 449)\
Iteration 07 With k = 23  ==> Result: Accuracy 95.10% (427 correct predictions out of 449)\
Iteration 08 With k = 37  ==> Result: Accuracy 93.76% (421 correct predictions out of 449)\
Iteration 09 With k = 49  ==> Result: Accuracy 92.87% (417 correct predictions out of 449)

>-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(We notice that k=3 gives us a 97% accuracy for a 75/25 split in the input data.)
